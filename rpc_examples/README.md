# JSON RPC Examples

This directory contains scripts and examples of the JSON RPC encoding for
"execution" clients.

The examples were generated using scripts also available in this directory.
Whilst these examples were generated with Geth (Catalyst), they *should* be
able to be run against any execution client.

This information should help application and consensus clients write unit tests
and understand the RPC format.

## Example: `consensus_assembleBlock`
